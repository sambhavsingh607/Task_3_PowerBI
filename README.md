## 3. Data Source & Preparation

The analysis was conducted on the `sales_data_sample.csv` file, with critical data preparation performed in Power Query.

* **File:** `sales_data_sample.csv`
* **Key Preparation Steps:**
    * **Data Type Conversion:** Successfully converted the `ORDERDATE` column to a **Date/Time** type using **Locale (English US)** to handle the date format ambiguity.
    * **Time Dimensions:** Extracted **Year**, **Month Name**, and **Quarter** columns to enable robust time-series charting.

## 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following core business metrics were calculated using **DAX Measures** and prominently displayed on KPI cards:

| KPI | DAX Formula | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Sales** | `SUM('sales_data_sample'[SALES])` | Total Revenue generated. |
| **Total Orders** | `DISTINCTCOUNT('sales_data_sample'[ORDERNUMBER])` | Total unique transactions (Order Volume). |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | `DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])` | Revenue efficiency per order. |
| **Quantity Sold** | `SUM('sales_data_sample'[QUANTITYORDERED])` | Total units moved. |

## 5. Visualizations and Interactivity

The dashboard utilizes a strategic set of visuals to facilitate detailed drill-down analysis.

| Category | Visual Type | Key Fields | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time Series** | Line Chart | `Month Name`, `Year`, `[Total Sales]` | Tracks **Year-over-Year growth and seasonality.** |
| **Breakdowns** | Bar, Map, Donut | `PRODUCTLINE`, `COUNTRY`, `DEALSIZE` | Identifies **top revenue drivers and geographic concentration.** |
| **Slicers** | Vertical List/Dropdown | `YEAR_ID`, `COUNTRY`, `PRODUCTLINE` | Allows instant, interactive filtering of all report visuals. |
